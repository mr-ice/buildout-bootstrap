Buildout has an awesome bootstrap.py that you can
run only if you already have python and a buildout.cfg.

This is available at:
  curl -O http://downloads.buildout.org/2/bootstrap.py

This script provides a bash script that when run will
do several things:

    1. prompt for a list of eggs to add to buildout.cfg
    2. create a minimal buildout.cfg for the initial buildout
    3. download buildout.py
    4. run buildout.py (which will create bin/buildout)
    5. run bin/buildout to install pip, virtualenv, and other tools as
       specified by the eggs you input 6.
    6. run bin/virtualenv, which will create bin/activate and some other
       symlinks so that the local bin/ directory is self contained
    7. source bin/activate to use the locally configured path
    8. run bootstrap.py again from the local bin/ directory
    9. run bin/buildout again with the local bin/ directory

The result will be a self-contained virtualenv based buildout configured
package directory for any of your python projects.
